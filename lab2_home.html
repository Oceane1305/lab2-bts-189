        <h2> How to Prevent Food Waste</h2>
        
        <p>Food choices affect your health and the environment. Between 30% and 40% of food in the U.S. is thrown out or wasted each year, according to the Department of Agriculture. That equals about 133 billion pounds and $161 billion. Food loss occurs at every step in the food supply chain from production to consumption. Some examples are spoilage during storage and transport, or exposure to insects and rodents, bacteria or mold. Sorting out blemishes or imperfections produces results in loss, as does consumers buying more than they need or can consume. Not only is edible food wasted, but all the energy, fertilizer and land use that went into producing that food is wasted as well.</p>
        
        
        <p> Food waste in America has skyrocketed in recent years, tripling in just five decades and it is now estimated to be 30-40% of its entire food supply, valued between US$161 and $218 billion. Today, the US counts as the second highest country in the world for food waste per capita, behind only Australia. Sadly, Americans throw away more food than the citizens of the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Sweden combined, equivalent to nearly 206 billion pounds (103 million tons). On a daily basis, that’s about 0.5 kilograms (one pound) of food discarded by one American.</p>

        <h2>Preventing Wasted Food At Home</h2>
        
        <p>Most people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce to parts of fruits and vegetables that could be eaten or repurposed. One-third of all food in the United States goes uneaten. EPA estimates that in 2018, about 81 percent - 20.3 tons - of households' wasted food ended up in landfills or combustion facilities1. Preventing food from going to waste is one of the easiest and most powerful actions you can take to save money and lower your climate change footprint by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and conserving natural resources.</p>

           <ul>
               
        
            <li>Planning at least a few meals for each week is a great way to ensure you have healthy meals. 
                
            <li>It also prevents you from buying too much food because you feel like you need to be prepared for anything. 
                
            <li>Coordinate your meals so you aren't using completely different ingredients for every recipe.</li>
               
            <li>For example, plan to eat broccoli as a side one night and in a casserole the next</li>

                   <li>Take stock of your pantry, refrigerator and freezer before going to the store to prevent overbuying.</li>
                       
                    <li>Keep a running list of meals and their ingredients that your household already enjoys - that way, you can easily choose, shop for, and prepare meals that you are likely to consume.</li>
                       
                    <li>Plan your meals for the week before you go shopping and buy only the things needed for those meals.</li>
                       
                    <li>Look in your refrigerator, freezer, and pantry first to avoid buying food you already have. Make a list each week of what needs to be used up and plan upcoming meals around it.</li>
                       
                    <li>Include quantities on your shopping list noting how many meals you’ll make with each item to avoid overbuying. For example: “salad greens - enough for two lunches”. </li>
                    
                    <li>Buying food from bulk bins can save you money and reduce food waste and packaging as you can purchase the amount of food you need as opposed to a pre-determined amount. When buying in bulk, remember to store food properly in airtight, labeled containers. </li>

                    <li>Leftovers aren’t just for holidays. Although many people save excess food from large meals, it is often forgotten in the fridge, then tossed when it goes bad.</li>
                        
                    <li>Storing leftovers in a clear glass container, rather than in an opaque container, helps ensure you don’t forget the food.</li>
                        
                    <li> If you happen to cook a lot and you regularly have leftovers, designate a day to use up any that have accumulated in the fridge. It’s a great way to avoid throwing away food.</li>

                <li>One of the biggest reasons I hear people say they don't eat fruits and vegetables is because "When I buy it, it ends up going bad, and I will throw it out anyway."</li> 
                     
                <li>Start by only buying what you can eat in a week. 
                    
                <li>Store greens with a paper towel in a plastic container in the crisper drawer, tomatoes and bananas on the counter, potatoes and onions in a cool, dark place and fresh herbs in a glass of water. 
                    
                <li>Have some frozen fruits and vegetables on hand in case you eat all your fresh produce before your next grocery day</li>
                     
                <li>Most veggies, especially those that could wilt (such as leafy greens, carrots, cucumbers, and broccoli) should go in the high humidity drawer of the fridge.</li>
                     
                <li>Most fruits, as well as vegetables that tend to rot (such as mushrooms and peppers), should go in the low humidity drawer of the fridge.</li>
                     
                <li>Some fruits (such as bananas, apples, pears, stone fruits, and avocados) release ethylene gas as they ripen, making other nearby produce ripen, and potentially spoil, faster. Store these away from other produce.</li>

                <li>You also can find small composting containers that you can keep in your home</li>
                 
                <li> Composting leftover food is a beneficial way to reuse food scraps, turning food waste into energy for plants.</li>
                 
                <li>While not everyone has room for an outdoor composting system, there’s a wide range of countertop composting systems that make this practice easy and accessible for everyone, even those with limited space.</li>
                 
                <li>An outdoor composter may work well for someone with a large garden, while a countertop composter is best for city dwellers with houseplants or small herb gardens.</li>

                    <p>You also can start a relationship with a local farmer through a community-supported agriculture or farmers market to get your hands on some imperfect produce. Remember, don't purchase bruised or spoiled produce.</p>

                <p>Vegetable scraps and peels can be made into soup stock. Apples or blueberries that are soft work perfectly cooked in oatmeal.</p>

        <p> I chose food waste as a subject because from a very young age, it has always been one of the good values instilled in me by my parents. In my opinion it is very important to reduce the waste of food because it helps first to prevent our environment.

If we made our food plans well at home, we could give the surplus food to people who are hungry and this would be a double advantage because not only will we be helping people to feed themselves but also we will reduce/prevent the waste of food. food.</p>
